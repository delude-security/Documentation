Running A fake Wordpress Install: [Example 1: Running a fake Wordpress installÂ¶](https://adhdproject.github.io/#!Tools/Annoyance/Wordpot.md#Example_1:_Running_a_fake_Wordpress_install)
- Wordpot runs by default without any additional configuration required.
Simply run the script with whatever command line arguments you need for
your situation. With ADHD, by default you should have apache listening
on port 80. So you might need to specify an alternative port number, or
to disable apache for the time that you're running this script.
    ```sh 
    /opt/wordpot$ sudo python ./wordpot.py --port=4444
    ```
- You can view your fancy new fake wordpress install by opening your web
browser and navigating to "http://localhost:4444"
