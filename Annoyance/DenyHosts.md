Definition
   - Script intended to prevents SSH server brute force attacks
   - Upon discovering a repeatedly malicious host, DenyHosts prevents future break-in attempts from that host using iptables, PF firewall, or updating the /etc/hosts.deny file
   - Options to log/notify all suspricious activity / thwarted abuse
     - Tracks non-existent and existing users when login attempt fails
     - Tracks offending hosts / suspicious logins (logins by a host with many failed attempts)
     - Parses /var/log/secure to find all login attempts and filters failed and successful attempts
    - DenyHosts 2.0 introduces synchronization mode which allows DenyHosts daemons to proactively thwart attackers before they strike your ssh server.
        - Since the release of DenyHosts 2.0 (late January) DenyHosts has thwarted over 205,000 hack attempts (39,000 unique) from over 150 countries
